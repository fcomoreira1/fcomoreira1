# Hi there! 👋 I'm Moreira

## 🚀 About Me
I'm an MSc student at ETH Zurich doing an AI major (machine intelligence) with a data management systems minor. I also recently graduated BSc in CS and math with Summa Cum Laude at École Polytechnique. 

I am particularly passionate about AI research, particularly in LLMs, gen AI, and large-scale data systems. The research topics I have been working on recently are LLM backdooring/model poisoning and AI for math. As a math olympiad medalist, it is exciting to see the advancements in formal theorem proving and to give my contribution to this effort! Previously I explored efficient Transformer design during my BSc thesis and generative seismic data modeling during an exchange semester at ETHZ.

On the side, I am excited about specialty coffee and spend the necessary time to extract the most of the amazing beans I get access to. I enjoy running especially to explore new places; traveling and trying the best food spots around; reading about health or productivity but also sporadically historical literature and romances; watching football!
